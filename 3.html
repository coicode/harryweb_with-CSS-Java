     <h2>story</h2><br>
     "Harry Potter" story's main characters is <strong>Ron, Hermione, and Harry Potter</strong>.
     On his eleventh birthday, Harry learned that <strong>he was a wizard</strong>.<br>
     He began attending Hogwarts in <strong>1991</strong> and was Sorted into Gryffindor House.<br>
     However, the Sorting Hat wanted to put him in Slytherin. At school, Harry became best friends with Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.<br>
     He later became the youngest Quidditch Seeker in over a century and eventually the captain of his house's team, winning two Quidditch Cups.<br>
     He became even better known in his early years for protecting the Philosopher's Stone from Voldemort, saving Ron's sister Ginny Weasley, solving the mystery of the Chamber of Secrets, slaying Salazar Slytherin's basilisk, and learning how to conjure a corporeal stag Patronus at the age of thirteen.<br>
     In his fourth year, Harry won the Triwizard Tournament, although the competition ended with the tragic death of Cedric Diggory and the return of Lord Voldemort. During the next school year, Harry reluctantly taught and led Dumbledore's Army. He also fought in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, during which he lost his godfather, Sirius Black.<br>
     Harry played a significant role in many other battles of the Second Wizarding War.<br>
     He, Ron, and Hermione hunted down and destroyed <strong>Voldemort's Horcruxes</strong>.<br>
     During the Battle of Hogwarts Harry personally saw the deaths of Severus Snape and Fred Weasley and learned that Remus Lupin, Nymphadora Tonks, Colin Creevey, and many others had fallen in battle as well.<br>
     He encountered Voldemort and sacrificed himself, knowing that his doing so was the only way to destroy the fragment of Voldemort's soul inside him.<br>
     When told he could choose to live or to "move on", Harry chose to live.<br>
     In limbo, after Voldemort cursed him in the forest clearing, Albus Dumbledore gave Harry advice and background information on the Dark Lord.<br>
     After he awoke he confronted Voldemort and defeated him once and for all.<br>
     Harry was also notable for being the only known Master of Death, having united the three Deathly Hallows at the mere age of seventeen.<br>
     After the war, Harry became an Auror and helped reform and revolutionise the Ministry of Magic.[56] At some point, he married Ginny Weasley, with whom he had three children: James Sirius (named after his father and godfather), Albus Severus (named after Albus Dumbledore and Severus Snape), and Lily Luna (named after his mother and Luna Lovegood). He was also named the godfather of Edward Remus Lupin.<br>
     In 2007 Harry was promoted to Head of the Auror Office at the age of 26 and would occasionally deliver Defence Against the Dark Arts lectures at Hogwarts.<br>
     He later went on to be Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement by the summer of 2020.<br>
